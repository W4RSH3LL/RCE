# Remote Command Execution Tool

This project consists of two Python scripts that enable remote command execution through a backdoor communication mechanism. The listener script sets up a server that waits for incoming connections from the backdoor client. Once a connection is established, various commands can be executed remotely, and files can be uploaded or downloaded.

## Version 1

It is only the first version of this project. It is very buggy, and it still needs some improvement.

## Components

1. **Listener.py**: This Python script waits for incoming connections and allows for remote command execution, file downloads, uploads, and system persistence setup.
2. **Reverse_Backdoor.py**: This Python script connects to the listener and executes received commands, including file operations and system commands.

## Features

- **Command Execution**: Execute any system command on the connected client.
- **File Upload/Download**: Transfer files to and from the connected client.
- **Persistent Access**: Setup commands to maintain persistence on the client system.

| Library     | Description                                                                          |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `socket`    | Provides low-level networking interface to set up listening server and client sockets. |
| `json`      | Used to encode and decode data into a lightweight data interchange format.            |
| `base64`    | Encodes and decodes binary data to ASCII strings for easy transmission over networks. |
| `subprocess`| Used to execute system commands and retrieve their outputs.                          |
| `os`        | Provides a way to use operating system dependent functionality like reading or writing to a file system. |
| `sys`       | Provides access to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter. |
| `shutil`    | Offers high-level file operations, particularly file copying and removal.             |

## Installation âœ…:
- `git clone https://github.com/W4RSH3LL/RCE.git`
- `cd RCE`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

### Setting up the Listener

Make sure you modify the attacker_ip and port_to_listen_on in both of the scripts

Run the listener script on the server with an IP address and port number:

```
python3 listener.py
```

## Setting up the Backdoor

Run the backdoor script on the client machine, specifying the server's IP address and port number to establish a connection:

```
python3 reverse_backdoor.py
```

## Commands
- `upload <path>`: Uploads a file to the connected client. (Not working properly yet)
- `download <path>`: Downloads a file from the connected client. (Not working properly yet)
- `persist <path>`: Sets up persistence on the client using the provided path for the executable. (Not working properly yet)
- `cd <directory>`: Changes the current working directory on the client.
